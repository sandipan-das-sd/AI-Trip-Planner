            "1. Expand the output to cover a range or multiple points (Options 1 & 3).\n",
            "2. Explicitly model the uncertainty in the prediction (Options 2 & 4).\n",
            "Option 3 (Quantile Regression LSTMs) seems most aligned with the requirement of providing multiple 'high-confidence target prices' as quantiles directly represent points in the distribution with associated probability levels.\n",
            "Option 2 (predicting mean and variance) also allows for confidence interval calculation.\n",
            "Option 4 (Bayesian LSTMs) provides a more principled way to capture uncertainty.\n",

This indicates the instruments data fetched does not contain options matching the user's input criteria. To address this, I will modify the `fetch_option_data` function to be more robust by first re-fetching the instruments data *within* the function itself to ensure it's using the latest data. Then, if the exact option is not found, it will search for the closest option *across all available expiries* with the requested strike and type, prioritizing options near the current date if possible, before giving up. This makes the data fetching step more resilient to variations in available instruments.\n",
